	<h1>Quality: About This Data Set</h1>
      <!--    <p>Write a brief summary about the quality of the data set here</a></p>-->
        
        <p>Brief: This data is quite high quality in my mind. First, its volume is big enough. It includes over 40,000 reviews with comprehensive variables to describe a tirp experience.
        Second, its data is diverse. It includes different reviews for almost 200 different airlines and from different passengers came from almost 200 different countries.
        In addition, as the author of the github page of this dataset said, this data has been also cited in many webpage articles and reviews.</p>
        <p>However, there are also some shortcomming in this data. As showed by Trifacta Wrangler, the integrality of some variables, including "aircraft" (A380, A330...), "type_traveller" (Business, Leisure...), "wifi_connectivity_rating", "ground_service_rating"
        is low. In these variables, only less than 10 percent data is valid. These variables are almost full of void value.</p>
      </div>

    
      <div class="page-header">
	<h2>Is the data complete?</h2>
<!--	<p>If not, what is missing and what concerns does it raise?
	What is your evidence for this?</p> <img src="img/airline_overall.png" alt="dataset overall status" >  -->
	<p>This dataset is quite completed and representative in my mind.</p>
	<p>Frist, it literally include 41,396 reviews with 15 variables. And the majority of variables are full by correct-formatted values.</p>
	<iframe width="800" height="600" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://fusiontables.google.com/embedviz?q=select+col1+from+18MyHVh8LRiSZSxJtHEzsCW6sCI4y0XkCSxsr9usr&amp;viz=MAP&amp;h=false&amp;lat=26.283819485058793&amp;lng=342.13246912499994&amp;t=1&amp;z=3&amp;l=col1&amp;y=2&amp;tmplt=2&amp;hml=ONE_COL_LAT_LNG"></iframe>
	<p>Second, As showed in the map above, these reviews are made by different passengers from almost all over the world.</p>
	</div>
      
      <div class="page-header">
	<h2>Is the data coherent?</h2>
	<p>Does it make sense relative to itself? Does it match your
	expectations? Are the distributions sensible? What is your
	evidence for this?</p>
	<p>This dataset is coherent. When I was exploring this dataset, I sampled and reviewed some piece of reivews, they looks a strong interally coherent.
	For example, If a passenger left complains in the "content" variables, the value in "overall_rating", "cabin_saft_rating", and/or "seat_comfort_rating" would
	corresponding drop.</p>
	<p>Also, it mainly matchs my expectation and learns from other relative research. As the question described in the Home page, "Passengers in which cabin(s) feel most satisfied in general?",
	the result summerized from this dataset shows similar pattern which I heard from other research.</p>
	<p>In addition, from the perspective of data's sensibility, as chart showed in the next question, we could see that these variables vary significantly.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p></p>
      </div>

      <div class="page-header">
	<h2>Is the data correct?</h2>
<!--	<p>What aspects of this data can you verify? How did you do so? What did
	you find?</p>  -->
	<p></p>
	<p>This dataset may be not very relaible. Generally, rating data are likely to be scattered in normal distribution. So, I picked 3 rating aspects for observing if thses reviews distributed normally.</p>

     <p>These three rating variables picked above are highly complete variables in this dataset (void or incurrect-formatted data are less than 10 percence in these variables).
     However, we could find in charts above that most of them did not show a strong normal distribution shape, on the contrary, like overall_rating, part of them even show a strong polarization shape.</p>
     <p>But, this may be also reasonable, because the source of this dataset, Skytrax, is a 3rd-party airline review website. This means if a review did not have a strong motivation to review his or her trip experience, they might not
     want to write a review on this website. Therefore, the reviews recorded in its dataset will become polarized. Highly satisfied and highly disappointed passengers are more willing to share their experience to others. 
     <p>In a nutshell, though this dataset shows a slightly abnormal status, I think, it mainly can be viewed reasonable and correct. However, this dataset may biased. And all result derived from this dataset should be carefully processed to rule out thses potential bias.</p>
